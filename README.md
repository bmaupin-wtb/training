# Pulumi Training

This repo contains artifacts for Pulumi training sessions.  
The intent is to provide directories that can be used with `pulumi new <url>` as part of hands-on sessions so as to avoid having to do a lot of typing or copy/pasting.

Each subfolder is focused on a given cloud provider and language and contains additional folders for specific lessons.  
The lesson-specific folders are set up such that `pulumi new <URL>` can be used to pull down the base code for the exercise as well as the solutions.
