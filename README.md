# Pulumi Training

This repo contains artifacts for Pulumi training sessions.  
The intent is to provide directories that can be used with `pulumi new <url>` as part of hands-on sessions so as to avoid having to do a lot of typing or copy/pasting.

Structure of the repo:

- slides: Contains PDF copies of the course slideware.
- cloud-language: subfolders with the exercises' code artifacts and solutions.  
  The lesson-specific folders are set up such that `pulumi new <URL>` can be used to pull down the base code for the exercise as well as the solutions.
